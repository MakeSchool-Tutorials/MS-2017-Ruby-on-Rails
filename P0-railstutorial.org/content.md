Create a new repository in the Make School '17 organization with [this link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/8d89144410bdf2de9f974c2bc17f1542). Clone that repo to your machine.

Then work through the excellent and free [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/), making sure to regularly commit and push your code! *Do not* use the Cloud9 web-development environment mentioned in the tutorial - instead work locally on your machine. Follow the instructions at [InstallRails.com](http://installrails.com/) to install Rails properly. Once Rails is installed, you can use a text editor, like [Atom](https://atom.io) to code.


Railstutorial.org has you make multiple Rails projects - you can put each project in separate directories in your repo.

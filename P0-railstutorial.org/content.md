Create a new repository in the Make School '17 organization with [this link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/8d89144410bdf2de9f974c2bc17f1542). Clone that repo to your machine.

Then work through the excellent and free [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/), making sure to regularly commit and push your code! *Do not* use the Cloud9 web-development environment mentioned in the tutorial - instead work locally on your machine, using [Atom](atom.io) for example.
